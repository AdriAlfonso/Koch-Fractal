# Koch-Fractal
#### In this repo I will be drawing Koch's fractal using Pyton and Turtle.

The Koch fractal, also known as the Koch snowflake, is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractals to be described. It is named after the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch, who introduced it in 1904.

This fractal is created by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively replacing each line segment with four smaller line segments of equal length, arranged in a pattern that resembles a flat-topped snowflake. The process is then repeated on each of the smaller line segments, resulting in an infinitely complex and detailed shape.

What is particularly interesting about the Koch fractal is that its perimeter is infinite, even though it encloses a finite area. This property is a characteristic of many fractals and is related to their self-similarity and intricate structure at all scales.

The Koch fractal is a fascinating and visually stunning example of the beauty and complexity that can arise from simple mathematical processes.
